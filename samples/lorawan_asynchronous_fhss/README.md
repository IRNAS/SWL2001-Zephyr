# LoRaWAN application sending asynchronous LR-FHSS uplinks

This sample is based on `SWSD001/apps/examples/lorawan_asynchronous_fhss`.

All configuration of the sample is done at the top of `main.c`, where LoRaWAN keys and other settings can be set.

## Sample behaviour

The sample first initializes the Basics modem and button 2 on the DK.
The device will attempt to join the LoRaWAN network.
After joining, a press on `button 2` on the DK will send an uplink message with the number of button presses.

Upon reception of any LinkADRReq command from the network server, the application will request the list of available datarates from LoRa Basics Modem. If LR-FHSS datarates are available, a custom ADR profile will be programmed so that all future uplinks will be transmitted over LR-FHSS. If a LinkADRReq command is never received, or if no LR-FHSS datarates are available, the application will not change the ADR profile and LoRa uplinks will be transmitted.

Note that for this application to work as expected for the EU-868 region, the LoRaWAN network server must first configure LR-FHSS channels using the NewChannelReq command, and then activate those channels for LR-FHSS datarates 8-9, 10-11, or 8-11 in the channel mask using the LinkADRReq command. This is not standard network server behavior, and requires a custom network server installation, as described below.

For this application to work as expected for the US-915 region, the LoRaWAN network server must activate one of the TX channels 64-71 for at least one of the LR-FHSS datarates 5-6 in the channel mask using the LinkADRReq command. This may require a custom network server installation, as described below.

For this application to work as expected for the AU-915 region, the LoRaWAN network server must activate one of the TX channels 64-71 for the LR-FHSS datarate 7 in the channel mask using the LinkADRReq command. This may require a custom network server installation, as described below.

### Known limitations

For the US-915 and AU-915 regions, this application currently must use a relatively wide Rx1 receive window. In order to do this, `smtc_modem_set_crystal_error_ppm()` is called during LoRa Basics Modem initialization.

This demo application only supports the cases where datarates 8-9, 10-11, or 8-11 are supported by the gateway.

### Prerequisites

This example assumes that a ChirpStack network server stack has been downloaded and installed. The stack can be installed on a Debian or Ubuntu machine, or on a Raspberry Pi, as described [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/project/guides/debian-ubuntu/).

You must follow the 'Connecting a gateway' and 'Connecting a device' instructions as well, defining a device supporting LoRaWAN Mac version 1.0.4, with regional parameters revision 'RP002-1.0.3', ADR algorithm 'LoRa and LR-FHSS ADR algorithm', and 'Device supports OTAA'.

## ChirpStack Network Server configuration for LR-FHSS operation in the EU-868 region

In order to get the network server to create the necessary LR-FHSS channels on the end device, it is necessary to modify the `/etc/chirpstack-network-server/chirpstack-network-server.toml` file.

For the purposes of this demo, assume that your gateway is properly configured for the EU-868 region, and it has the following LR-FHSS channel configuration:

```
{ "freq_hz": 867200000, "ocw": 137000 },
{ "freq_hz": 867400000, "ocw": 137000 },
{ "freq_hz": 867600000, "ocw": 137000 },
{ "freq_hz": 867800000, "ocw": 137000 },
{ "freq_hz": 868000000, "ocw": 137000 },
{ "freq_hz": 868200000, "ocw": 137000 },
{ "freq_hz": 868600000, "ocw": 336000 }
```

According to `RP002-1.0.3 LoRaWAN Regional Parameters`, datarates 8 and 9 occupy 137 kHz, and datarates 10 and 11 occupy 336 kHz.

If you wish to configure the network server to place datarates 8 and 9 in the 137 kHz channel at 867200000 Hz, add the following lines to the `[network_server.network_settings]` section.
```
    [[network_server.network_settings.extra_channels]]
    frequency=867200000
    min_dr=8
    max_dr=9
```

If you wish to configure the network server to place datarates 10 and 11 in the 336 kHz channel at 868600000 Hz, add the following lines to the `[network_server.network_settings]` section.
```
    [[network_server.network_settings.extra_channels]]
    frequency=868600000
    min_dr=10
    max_dr=11
```

Make sure that name='EU868' in the '[network_server.band]' section

Once this file has been edited, restart the network server:
``` bash
$ systemctl restart chirpstack-network-server
```

## ChirpStack Network Server configuration for LR-FHSS operation in the US-915 region

According to `RP002-1.0.3 LoRaWAN Regional Parameters`, datarates 5 and 6 occupy 1523 kHz.

For the purposes of this demo, assume that your gateway is properly configured for the US-915 region, and it has the following LR-FHSS channel configuration:

```
{ "freq_hz": 909400000, "ocw": 1523000 } /* 1523kHz channel */
```

Any of the 8 LR-FHSS upstream channels described in 'RP002-1.0.3 LoRaWAN Regional Parameters' can be used (903.0 to 914.2, stepping by 1.6 MHz), and depending on your gateway, you may be able to enable more than one. Here, we have chosen the 4th LR-FHSS channel, at 909.4 MHz (903.0 + 4 * 1.6  = 909.4). This corresponds to the 500-kHz-LoRa/1523-kHz-LR-FHSS channel 68 (64 + 4).

In order to get the network server to activate the necessary LR-FHSS channels on the end device, it may be necessary to modify the `/etc/chirpstack-network-server/chirpstack-network-server.toml` file. Make sure that the 'enabled_uplink_channels' variable of section '[network_server.network_settings]' contains channel 68, and that name='US_902_928' in the '[network_server.band]' section.

If it was necessary to change this file, restart the network server:
``` bash
$ systemctl restart chirpstack-network-server
```

## ChirpStack Network Server configuration for LR-FHSS operation in the AU-915 region

According to `RP002-1.0.3 LoRaWAN Regional Parameters`, datarate 7 occupies 1523 kHz.

For the purposes of this demo, assume that your gateway is properly configured for the AU-915 region, and it has the following LR-FHSS channel configuration:

```
{ "freq_hz": 915900000, "ocw": 1523000 } /* 1523kHz channel */
```

Any of the 8 LR-FHSS upstream channels described in 'RP002-1.0.3 LoRaWAN Regional Parameters' can be used (915.9 to 927.1, stepping by 1.6 MHz), and depending on your gateway, you may be able to enable more than one. Here, we have chosen the first LR-FHSS channel, at 915.9 MHz. This corresponds to the 500-kHz-LoRa/1523-kHz-LR-FHSS channel 64.

In order to get the network server to activate the necessary LR-FHSS channels on the end device, it may be necessary to modify the `/etc/chirpstack-network-server/chirpstack-network-server.toml` file. Make sure that the 'enabled_uplink_channels' variable of section '[network_server.network_settings]' contains channel 64, and that name='AU915' in the '[network_server.band]' section.

If it was necessary to change this file, restart the network server:
``` bash
$ systemctl restart chirpstack-network-server
```
