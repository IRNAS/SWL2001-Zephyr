# Lorawan sample

This sample is based on `SWSD001/apps/examples/tx_rx_continuous`.

All configuration of the sample is done at the top of `main.c`, where LoRaWAN keys and other settings can be set.

## Sample behaviour

The application will automatically start a TX continuous or a RX continuous according to the configuration given by the user.
